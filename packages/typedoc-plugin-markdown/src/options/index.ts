/**
 * Contains all the option declarations and types used in the plugin.
 *
 * Options exposed to TypeDoc are added as a named export to the declarations options.
 *
 * @example
 *
 * ```ts
 * \/**
 *  * Some more detailed comments about the option.
 *  *
 *  * @category Display
 *  *\/
 * export const myNewOption: Partial<DeclarationOption> = {
 *   help: 'A short description of the option.',
 *   type: ParameterType.Boolean,
 *   defaultValue: false,
 *  };
 *  ```
 *
 *  This will be exposed to TypeDoc as a new option when bootstrapping the plugin, with the name of the option the name of the exported variable.
 *
 *  In addition, when the `prebuild` task is run:

 * - The option type will be added to `TypeDocOptionsMap`.
 * - The documentation will be updated using the JSDoc comments and categorized as per the `@category` tag.
