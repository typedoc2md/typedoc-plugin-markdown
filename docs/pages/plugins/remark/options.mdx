# Options

## remarkPlugins

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">An array of remark plugin names to be executed.</Callout>

> Accepts an Array.

You can include any compatible [remark plugins](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/blob/main/doc/plugins.md) or create and reference your own locally.

Each plugin you wish to use must be installed individually.

Options can be provided as either an array of strings or an array of strings with associated options.

```json filename="typedoc.json"
{
  "remarkPlugins": [
    "remark-github",
    [
      "remark-toc",
      {
        "maxDepth": 3
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

## defaultRemarkPlugins

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  A set of flags that control the enabling or disabling of remark plugins that
  are loaded by default.
</Callout>

>

By default, the plugins [`remark-gfm`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm), [`remark-frontmatter`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-frontmatter), and [`remark-mdx`](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx/tree/main/packages/remark-mdx) are included, as these are considered the most common use cases.

However, these plugins modify the default parsing behavior of remark, which may not be ideal for all scenarios.

If you'd like to disable any of these default plugins, simply set the corresponding flag to `false`.

```json filename="typedoc.json"
{
  "defaultRemarkPlugins": {
    "gfm": true,
    "frontmatter": true,
    "mdx": true
  }
}
```

## remarkStringifyOptions

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">Custom options for the remark-stringify plugin.</Callout>

> Accepts a key/value object.

Under the hood, the [`remark-stringify`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/main/packages/remark-stringify) plugin is used to serialize the markdown into final output.

You can pass in options to the `remark-stringify` plugin using this option.

Please see https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/main/packages/remark-stringify#options

```json filename="typedoc.json"
{
  "remarkStringifyOptions": {
    "bullet": "+",
    "fence": "~"
  }
}
```
