  improvements.
</Callout>

## 🏗 Architectural Changes

- Handlebars as a dependency has been removed.
- Updated customization model with the ability to set hooks, events and custom theming.
- Improved test and linting coverage.

## 🌟 New Features

- Updated output file structure.
- Improved and cleaner UX configurable with options.
- Exported option types and JSON schema.
- Exposed navigation structure.
- Ability to customize static text.
- Comprehensive documentation and examples repository.

## 🏗️ Non-Breaking Changes

- Each module member is now output to its own file by default. See [`outputFileStrategy`](/docs/options#outputfilestrategy). To achieve the same output as v3 (whereby only Classes, Enums and Interfaces have their own file), set the [`membersWithOwnFile`](/docs/options#memberswithownfile) option.
- Parameters are output as a list by default. To achieve the same output as v3 (where parameters are output as a table), use [`parametersFormat=table`](/docs/options#parametersformat).
- Comment `@` tags are now displayed as headings.

## 💥 Breaking Changes

- The output file structure has changed so you may need to update any cross references into your docs from external sources.
- Setting `theme` to `"markdown"` is not required and should be removed.
- The option `indexTitle` has been removed. Please use the `"title.indexPage"` key with [`textContentMappings`](/docs/options#textcontentmappings).
- The option `allReflectionsHaveOwnDocument` has been removed (this behaviour is now the default). Please see See [`outputFileStrategy`](/docs/options#outputfilestrategy).
- The option `entryDocument` has been renamed to `entryFileName` to better reflect its purpose.
- The option `namedAnchors` has been renamed to `useHTMLAnchors` to better reflect its purpose.
- The option `hideInPageTOC` has been removed. In-page TOC are no longer included by default. You can include in-page TOCs by using [typedoc-plugin-remark](/plugins/remark) and the [remark-toc](plugins/remark/suggested-plugins#remark-toc) plugin.
- The option `objectLiteralTypeDeclarationStyle` has been removed. Please use [`typeDeclarationFormat=list`](/docs/options#typedeclarationformat).
