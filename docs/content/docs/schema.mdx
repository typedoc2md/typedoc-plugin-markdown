# Schema

The plugin provides both a JSON Schema and TypeScript types so your IDE can
validate and autocomplete your configuration.

## JSON

You can attach a JSON Schema to your `typedoc.json` file so your editor can validate and autocomplete both TypeDoc's options and this plugin's options.

The schema is published with the package and is available locally in `node_modules`. It provides a combined schema that includes all options from TypeDoc and the plugin.

A hosted copy of the schema is also available at `typedoc-plugin-markdown.org/schema.json` for tools that can't resolve local package paths.
Using the local path is recommended to ensure the schema matches the installed plugin versions.

```json filename="typedoc.json"
{
  "$schema": "node_modules/typedoc-plugin-markdown/typedoc-plugin-markdown.schema.json",
  "plugin": ["typedoc-plugin-markdown"],
};
```

Note that VSCode should automatically pick up the latest TypeDoc schema without declaring, but without the plugin options.

## TypeScript

If you use a JavaScript-based config file, you can still get full type checking
and autocompletion by importing the plugin's `PluginOptions` type.

Because TypeDoc and the plugin both define their own options, you can combine them using an intersection type:

```js filename="typedoc.config.cjs"
// @ts-check

/** @type {import('typedoc').TypeDocOptions & import('typedoc-plugin-markdown').PluginOptions} */
module.exports = {
  plugin: ['typedoc-plugin-markdown'],
};
```
