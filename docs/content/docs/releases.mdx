## Versioning

This section should help you understand the versioning rules of the plugin and its compatibility with TypeDoc.

### Package Version

Please note that TypeDoc is still released within the 0.x.x range and may include breaking changes within each minor version release.

A new minor version of the plugin and be released with each minor TypeDoc version, and we will attempt to release in a non-breaking manner.

Besides the TypeDoc release versions, we aim to follow semantic versioning for the plugin:

- Bug fixes including minor UI tweaks will be released as patch versions.
- New features/options will be released as minor versions.
- UI changes implemented in a non-breaking manner will be released as minor versions.
- Breaking changes including option changes and fundamental UI changes will be released as major versions.

### Compatibility Table

We will follow the Node.js and TypeScript versions as specified in the TypeDoc `package.json` file.

Version compatibility for the plugin and TypeDoc is as follows:

| Plugin        | TypeDoc | Node  | TypeScript    |
| ------------- | ------- | ----- | ------------- |
| 4.5.x - 4.6.x | 0.28.x  | >= 18 | 5.0.x - 5.8.x |
| 4.3.x - 4.4.x | 0.27.x  | >= 18 | 5.0.x - 5.7.x |
| 4.1.x - 4.2.x | 0.26.x  | >= 18 | 4.6.x - 5.5.x |
| 4.0.x         | 0.25.x  | >= 16 | 4.6.x - 5.4.x |

## Migration Guides

### v4

v4.0 is a major release that includes a number of bug fixes, new features and
UX improvements.

#### Architectural Changes

- Handlebars as a dependency has been removed.
- Updated customization model with the ability to set hooks, events and custom theming.
- Improved test and linting coverage.

#### New Features

- Updated output file structure.
- Improved and cleaner UX configurable with options.
- Exported option types and JSON schema.
- Exposed navigation structure.
- Ability to customize static text.
- Comprehensive documentation and examples repository.

#### Non-Breaking Changes

- Each module member is now output to its own file by default. See <OptionLink type="display" name="outputFileStrategy" />. To achieve the same output as v3 (whereby only Classes, Enums and Interfaces have their own file), set the [`membersWithOwnFile`](/docs/options#memberswithownfile) option.
- Parameters are output as a list by default. To achieve the same output as v3 (where parameters are output as a table), use the `table` key of <OptionLink type="display" name="parametersFormat" />.
- Comment `@` tags are now displayed as headings.

#### Breaking Changes

- The output file structure has changed so you may need to update any cross references into your docs from external sources.
- Setting `theme` to `"markdown"` is not required and should be removed.
- The option `indexTitle` has been removed. Please use the `"title.indexPage"` key with <OptionLink type="display" name="textContentMappings" />.
- The option `allReflectionsHaveOwnDocument` has been removed (this behaviour is now the default). Please see See <OptionLink type="display" name="outputFileStrategy" />.
- The option `entryDocument` has been renamed to <OptionLink type="file" name="entryFileName" /> to better reflect its purpose.
- The option `namedAnchors` has been renamed to <OptionLink type="utility" name="useHTMLAnchors" /> to better reflect its purpose.
- The option `hideInPageTOC` has been removed. In-page TOC are no longer included by default. You can include in-page TOCs by using [typedoc-plugin-remark](/plugins/remark) and the [remark-toc](plugins/remark/suggested-plugins#remark-toc) plugin.
- The option `objectLiteralTypeDeclarationStyle` has been removed. Please use the `list` key of <OptionLink type="display" name="typeDeclarationFormat" />.
