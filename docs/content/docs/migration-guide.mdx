# Migration Guide (v4)

<Callout type="info">
  v4.0 is a major release that includes a number of bug fixes, new features and
  UX improvements.
</Callout>

## Architectural Changes

- Handlebars as a dependency has been removed.
- Updated customization model with the ability to set hooks, events and custom theming.
- Improved test and linting coverage.

## New Features

- Updated output file structure.
- Improved and cleaner UX configurable with options.
- Exported option types and JSON schema.
- Exposed navigation structure.
- Ability to customize static text.
- Comprehensive documentation and examples repository.

## Non-Breaking Changes

- Each module member is now output to its own file by default. See <OptionLink type="display" name="outputFileStrategy" />. To achieve the same output as v3 (whereby only Classes, Enums and Interfaces have their own file), set the [`membersWithOwnFile`](/docs/options#memberswithownfile) option.
- Parameters are output as a list by default. To achieve the same output as v3 (where parameters are output as a table), use the `table` key of <OptionLink type="display" name="parametersFormat" />.
- Comment `@` tags are now displayed as headings.

## Breaking Changes

- The output file structure has changed so you may need to update any cross references into your docs from external sources.
- Setting `theme` to `"markdown"` is not required and should be removed.
- The option `indexTitle` has been removed. Please use the `"title.indexPage"` key with <OptionLink type="display" name="textContentMappings" />.
- The option `allReflectionsHaveOwnDocument` has been removed (this behaviour is now the default). Please see See <OptionLink type="display" name="outputFileStrategy" />.
- The option `entryDocument` has been renamed to <OptionLink type="file" name="entryFileName" /> to better reflect its purpose.
- The option `namedAnchors` has been renamed to <OptionLink type="utility" name="useHTMLAnchors" /> to better reflect its purpose.
- The option `hideInPageTOC` has been removed. In-page TOC are no longer included by default. You can include in-page TOCs by using [typedoc-plugin-remark](/plugins/remark) and the [remark-toc](plugins/remark/suggested-plugins#remark-toc) plugin.
- The option `objectLiteralTypeDeclarationStyle` has been removed. Please use the `list` key of <OptionLink type="display" name="typeDeclarationFormat" />.
