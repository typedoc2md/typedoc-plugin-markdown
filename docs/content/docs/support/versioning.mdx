## Versioning

This page should help you understand the versioning rules of the plugin and its compatibility with TypeDoc.

## Package Version

Please note that TypeDoc is still released within the 0.x.x range and may include breaking changes within each minor version release.

A new minor version of the plugin and be released with each minor TypeDoc version, and we will attempt to release in a non-breaking manner.

Besides the TypeDoc release versions, we aim to follow semantic versioning for the plugin:

- Bug fixes including minor UI tweaks will be released as patch versions.
- New features/options will be released as minor versions.
- UI changes implemented in a non-breaking manner will be released as minor versions.
- Breaking changes including option changes and fundamental UI changes will be released as major versions.

## Compatibility Table

We will follow the Node.js and TypeScript versions as specified in the TypeDoc `package.json` file.

Version compatibility for the plugin and TypeDoc is as follows:
