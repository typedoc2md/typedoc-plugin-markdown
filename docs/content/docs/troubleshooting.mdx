# Troubleshooting

This guide covers common issues you may encounter when using the typedoc-plugin-markdown, along with solutions and explanations.

## TypeDoc Loaded Multiple Times

**Symptom:**

You're running TypeDoc and see the following error which is preventing docs from being generated:

> **[warning] TypeDoc has been loaded multiple times. This is commonly caused by plugins which have their own installation of TypeDoc.**

**Why?**:

This plugin declares TypeDoc as a peer dependency, so it won't install TypeDoc automatically.

If you're running TypeDoc in a standard setup and you're seeing this warning, your package manager is likely resolving dependencies in a way that causes multiple instances of TypeDoc to be loaded.

When installing globally, be aware of [npm/cli#7057](https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/7057).

**Solution:**

Use the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag when installing packages.

## `packageOptions` Not Working

**Symptom:**

You are setting options inside `packageOptions`, but they are being ignored.

**Why?**

The `packageOptions` field only applies to conversion options. Options exposed by this plugin apply during rendering, not conversion. That's why they won't work if placed inside `packageOptions`.

**Solution:**

Place all plugin specific options at the root level of your TypeDoc configuration.

See [TypeDoc packageOptions](https://typedoc.org/documents/Options.Package_Options.html).

## MDX Compilation Failed

**Symptom:**

You're using an MDX parser and see this error (or similar):

> **Error: MDX compilation failed**
>
> Cause: Could not parse expression with acorn

**Why?**

This is almost certainly caused by invalid MDX syntax in doc comments.

**Solution:**

- Wrap invalid MDX in backticks to treat it as a code block.
- Enable <OptionLink type="utility" name="sanitizeComments" /> to automatically escape problematic characters.
- Switch to CommonMark, if supported by your parser.
