# MDX vs. CommonMark

By default, Docusaurus treats Markdown files as MDX.

This means that non-conformant MDX syntax in your documentation comments will cause a compilation error.

If you don't need MDX features, you can opt into CommonMark, which allows for more relaxed Markdown parsing.

```js filename="docusaurus.config.js"
markdown: {
    format: 'detect',
}
```

See https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features#mdx-vs-commonmark for more information.
